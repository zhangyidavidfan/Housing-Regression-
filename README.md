# Kaggle Advance Housing Project

this an end to end analysis of an introductory dataset on the Kaggle website. The target variable of this data set is the sale prices of the houses, and the other variables included in this data set ranges from the location of house to its basic structure and parts.

the output of the prediction is evaluated by taking the rmse of the logarithm of the prices. I employed some basic feature engineering and Machine Learning technique in this notebook. my output resulted in an rmse iof 0.124, which is in the top quartile of the public leaderboard of kaggle.
